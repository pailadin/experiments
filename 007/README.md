## Goal Statements
* learn the fundamentals and the best practices in writing code using the Rust programming language
* demonstrate the use of the Rust programming language for building compute-intensive worker services

## Abstract
The Ethereum JSON-RPC API will be used to retrieve all the events generated by all ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 smart contracts. These events will then be used to build a data model that represents the ownership of the users of tokens of all types. The worker service which will run this operation will be written entirely in the Rust programming language.
