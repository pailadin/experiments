## Goal Statements
* create a "lucidchart" style web app that lets us make a sequence diagram

## Abstract
As mentioned in the goal statements, we're going to be making an app that lets us create sequence diagrams in the HTML canvas.
Currently using React in this, but most of the code is very vanilla, so we should be able to use this in
other projects as needed without too much hassle.
